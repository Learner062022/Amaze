# Testing Process Report  

## Testing Plan and Setup  

The testing process adheres to **Test Driven Developement (TDD)**, ensuring that the test cases are written before teh actual implementation of features. The steps include:

1. **Define test cases** based on expected behaviours and requirements.
2. **Run tests on the game prototype** in Unity project mode to validate functionalities.
3. **Refine the implementation** based on the failing tests, ensuring incremental improvement.
4. **Repeat testing cycles** until the target maturity level of the game is reached.

For the **GUI focus test**, additional steps are taken:
- **Specific UI components** are tested separately to ensure usability and responsiveness.
- Testers interact with menus and interface elements to validate design clarity and accessibility.
- Feedback on navigation and functionality is gathered for refinement.
